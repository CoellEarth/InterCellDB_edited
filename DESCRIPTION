Description: This tool provides databases covering human and mouse, and provides bunches of functions for analyzing on scRNA-seq data. The database collects a variety of public sources, including STRING, NCBI-gene, COMPARTMENTS, GO, Uniprot, etc. The analysis process starts with network analysis on all interactions, and then performs intercellular analysis on 2 specific cell clusters for exploring composition of actions, gene pair specificity, etc., and finally filters out some important gene pairs.
