Description: This tool provides databases covering human and mouse, and provides bunches of functions intended to serve for data analysis of scRNA-seq. Its databases collect a variety of data source, including STRING, NCBI-gene, COMPARTMENTS, GO, Uniprot, etc. Its function on analysis starts from fullview of cell-cell-interaction to specific interactions between specific clusters and intends to find a small subset of important gene pairs.
