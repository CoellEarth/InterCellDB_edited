\description{
A dataset contains the experiments-based interaction pairs of mouse genes, 
and is extracted from STRING database. It is further matched by Ligand/Receptor/ECM databases
in this package, and as a result, it has 2344 rows of pairs in total.
}
\details{
The subset of STRING data used are <taxonomy = Mus Musculus>, <score[experiments] > 0>.
